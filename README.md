Exercise 1:
- This will be a for loop, from 1 to 100.
- Each interaction will be a module check (%) to see if the number is divided by some or both option.
- As you will see on the second exercise, I've used some strategies to avoid bugs or problems, some of them are;
  - Using typescript.
  - Adding tests to cover many cases.
  - Split the logic on small methods

Exercise 2:
- The solution can be found on `country.service.ts` file.
- A practical example of the use of this service is on the `country.test.ts` file, and it are testing almost all the methods.
